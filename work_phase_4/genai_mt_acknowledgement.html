                    <p>
                        Due to my limited knowledge in advanced javascript and web apis, I mainly used Claude to help me
                        learn and improve the
                        javascript code for form validation, error handling, user feedback messages, loading and
                        displaying a leaderboard of top recipes and the timeline post, time and date display format for
                        the post timeline, modal component, newsletter subscription form, and also help me "Hackyly"
                        fix the forms to using the API but with different fields and labels. But, before I ask Claude, I
                        always try my best to create my own version of the code first by following the code from A3 and
                        A2, and also searching from W3Schools. This way, I still have control over the final code, and I
                        can still learn from the suggestions given by Claude.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Furthermore, to improve the design of several pages like FeedCrumbs page, CrumbsMap page, About
                        page, Crumbings page, and OZvents page, I used Claude to give me ideas on how to improve my
                        existing design, from the existing CSS and HTML. To still have control over the final design,
                        I always make sure to only ask for ideas on improving the design, and I still implement the
                        design changes myself and always give context about my ideas and design plannings from A3 and
                        user needs in A2 to Claude. Therefore, the final design still reflects my own ideas and
                        creativity.

                        Lastly, I used claude to help me troubleshoot and debug the accessibility audit issues found and
                        also the javascript errors found in the console. I always make sure to understand the issues
                        found and implement the fixes myself, rather than copy pasting the code given by Claude.

                    <p>
                        For the code related sections like form validation, error handling, user feedback messages,
                        loading and displaying a leaderboard of top recipes and the timeline post, time and date display
                        format for the post timeline, modal component, newsletter subscription form, and also help me
                        "Hackyly" fix the forms to using the API but with different fields and labels, I make sure to
                        try as
                        best as possible first to create my own version of the code first. After that, if I have
                        difficulties or feel like I want to improve some of the code, then I will ask Claude to give
                        me suggestions on how to improve my existing code. Even though some of the code given was very
                        good, most of them are not aligned with my existing code structure and my design plans, and I
                        could not understand some parts of the code. Therefore, rather than copy paste the code, I
                        mostly try to learn the code given by the AI and implement it myself.

                        alternatives for my hero sections, and mock datas and paragraphs for several sections. I make
                        sure all the suggestions are ethical and inclusive and also relevant to my original work, and
                        therefore I still have control over the final work given.

                        I carefully reviewed all the generated code by AI. Other than that, since my prompts are mostly
                        feedback related, and I also already have the original design, I did not copy pasted entire code
                        generated by AI, I only use several line of codes given whenever necessary. I also make sure
                        all of the components still follows the color scheme and overall existing design layout that
                        were established before in A3. I also always make sure to give context about my design ideas and
                        plannings from A3 and user needs in A2 to Claude, so that the suggestions given are relevant to
                        my original work. Therefore, the AI did not alter any ethical effect regarding the designs.

                    <p>
                        In addition to the theories I have learned in work phase 2 and 3, in this work phase 4, I also
                        learned
                        more about advanced javascript concepts and web apis like form validation, error handling, user
                        feedback messages, loading and displaying a leaderboard of top recipes and the timeline post,
                        time and date display format for the post timeline, modal component, and also how to "Hackyly"
                        fix the forms to using the API but with different fields and
                        labels. Claude helped me to understand these concepts better by giving me explanations and
                        examples that
                        are relevant to my current work. This way, I can learn more effectively and efficiently.
                        Furthermore, by using Claude to help me improve my existing code, I can learn from the
                        suggestions given and apply them to my future projects. Overall, I think using Claude as a
                        learning tool is a great way to enhance my knowledge and skills in web development.

                        I used these AI/MT tools to support and supplement my learning and work in this work phase 3.
                        All generated code, suggestions, and feedbacks were critically reviewed and adapted based on
                        my own needs and also the ethical considerations. I ensure the final work given reflects my
