                <p>
                    First off I just want to mention that I really enjoyed working this assignment 4. It was a really
                    it was a challanging yet fun experience to build a website end to end, from gathering the values,
                    needs, planning the features, learning to design ethical and accessible the UX/UI, and finally
                    implementing the website. Hats off to the teaching team for creating such an engaging and educative
                    course!

                            Below is my rationale regarding the implementation rationale and justification for the
                            design and
                            features that I have made in this assignment.

                                        Based on the client brief, values, and the user needs that I have identified in
                                        A2 and A3, i want to revolve the to revolve around an inclusive platform that
                                        foster meaningful connections through self expression. To achieve this, I have
                                        implemented several features, accessiblity considerations, and ethical design
                                        principles in the website.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>



                                        As explained in the
                                        <a href="../work_phase_3/site_map.html" class="conventional-link"
                                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sitemap in A3 </a>
                                        , each page in the sitemap is designed to answer all user needs and client
                                        brief. In order to accomplish the planning, I implement all the planned main
                                        pages in the sitemap. Overall, rhe website features such as FeedCrumbs,
                                        Crumbings, CrumbsMap, and OZvent are
                                        designed to facilitate sharing of culinary heritage, exploration of diverse food
                                        cultures, and community engagement. These features align with the user needs and
                                        client brief of promoting community connection and engagement through
                                        traditional culinary, while the about, account, and accessibility pages are
                                        designed to provide users with information about the platform, and customization
                                        options to enhance their experience, which also aligns with the client brief of
                                        ethical and inclusive design. Several other key elements to support the client
                                        brief
                                        and user needs are explained below.


                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        I use an inclusive, diverse, and warm hero section to welcome
                                        users from all backgrounds, which aligns with the client’s value of inclusivity.
                                        To support the reflective aspect of the client’s goals, I have used ethical and
                                        welcoming language throughout the website, encouraging users to share their
                                        stories and experiences related to food and culture to the wider community.
                                        Furtheremore, to make sure users feels more engaged, I have implemented
                                        behavorial elements such as dynamic contents, interactive components, and easy
                                        navigation to enhance user experience and encourage exploration.
                                        Furthermore, I also leverage
                                        the UX/UI
                                        design principles that I have learned throughout the course to create a
                                        user-friendly,
                                        for example the Gestralt principles of proximity, similarity, and Law of
                                        Prägnanz is fundamentally applied in the layout and visual hierarchy of the
                                        website to
                                        ensure clarity and ease of use. To also make the visceral design more appealing,
                                        I have
                                        used a warm color palette, professional typography, and culturally relevant
                                        imagery to create an emotional connection with the users, and also maintain
                                        consistency in design elements throughout the website to enhance usability and
                                        aesthetic appeal.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        Overall, my strategy to align the implementation with the client and user needs
                                        is basically by following the planned features, accessibility considerations,
                                        and ethical design principles that I have identified in the previous phases of
                                        the project, alongside with the knowledge and the skills that I have learned
                                        throughout the course.

                                    To make sure the platform is accessible to all users, I have implemented various
                                    accessibility features such as alt text for images, proper contrast ratio,
                                    screen reader compatibility and several other accessibility considerations. This
                                    aligns with the client’s value of inclusivity and ensures that users with
                                    diverse abilities can fully participate in the platform. To make sure the
                                    the platform accessibility is up to standard, I have conducted an accessibility
                                    audit using tools
                                    using IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker (screenshots available on Audit
                                    section).

                                    I have fixed all the accessibility issues that were identified in the audit, such as
                                    missing alt text, insufficient color contrast, and improper heading structure,
                                    except for in
                                    the crumbings page, where there is error "Violation Accessible name does not match
                                    or contain the visible label text" for the list item, which I could not find a way
                                    to fix it with the current limitation of the API that I used to fetch the data.
                                    However, I have made sure that all other aspects of the crumbings page are
                                    accessible, such as proper heading structure, and alt text for images. However,
                                    I am aware that IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker is not fully checks all the
                                    WCAG Level AA guidelines, so I have also do my best effort to manually check the
                                    website for other accessibility issues that might not be covered by the tool.

                                    <br>
                                    <br>

                                    Furtheremore, I have also make sure all the pages, modals, sidebars, and other
                                    components are fully mobile and tablet responsive, to ensure that users can access
                                    the platform from any device. This is achieved through responsive design techniques
                                    using grids, flexbox, media queries, and mobile first design approach.

                                    <br>
                                    <br>

                                    To make sure that the implementation is ethically sound, I have adhered to the
                                    ACS Code of Ethics throughout the design and development process. This includes
                                    ensuring user privacy for example, I adjust the
                                    newsletter
                                    subscription form
                                    to be only ask for email, name, and preferred community, instead of more
                                    sensitive data such as
                                    annual income and spending habits. This change is made to respect user privacy
                                    and minimize
                                    potential harm, in line with the ACS principles of honesty and respect.

                                    This platform also did not use any user tracking or third-party cookies, to
                                    further
                                    protect user privacy and ensure that users feel safe and secure while using the
                                    platform.

                                    <br>

                                    Overall, my approach to accessibility and ethical considerations is to prioritize
                                    user needs and rights, while also aligning with the client’s values and goals for
                                    the platform.

                                <div class="accordion-content">
                                    There are several variations from the A3 design proposal that I have made during the
                                    implementation phase. One of the variation is a slight change on the color scheme,
                                    where
                                    I have adjusted the colors to ensure better contrast and readability, while still
                                    maintaining the warm and inviting aesthetic that I proposed in A3. This change is
                                    made to enhance accessibility and ensure that all users can easily read and navigate
                                    the
                                    platform. Also, I have the adjustment in the planned navbar in A3, where I have
                                    planned to use mixed navbar and vertical sidebar navigation for
                                    desktop, but I ended up using only horizontal top navigation bar instead. This
                                    change is made to simplify the navigation and ensure consistent navigation
                                    experience
                                    across all pages, following the WCAG guidelines for navigation consistency. Another
                                    variation. I also made change in the hero section, where before I planned
                                    to use a text on top of image hero section, but I ended up seperating the text and
                                    image
                                    into two columns instead. This change is made to enhance readability and ensure that
                                    the text is easily legible, especially for users with visual impairments.

                                    Lastly, due to several technical such as API limitation and time constraint, I did
                                    not finished all the features as originally planned in A3. For example, I did not
                                    fully implement the post detail and community notes functionalities in the
                                    FeedCrumbs page, and I also did not fully implement some of the functionalities in
                                    the crumbings page, crumbs map, and Account page. But rest assured, those features
                                    are still partially implemented and functional to some extent, and I have made sure
                                    that the core features and functionalities grand picture of the planned features is
                                    still shown by the current implementation.

                                    <br>

                                    In addition with the planned features in A3, I have also added several additional
                                    features and enhancements, such as about page, modal and sidebar components, and
                                    several accessibility features customization in the account page.

                                    But overall, the core features and functionalities that I proposed in A3 have been
                                    implemented as planned, such as the pages, features, and accessibility
                                    considerations, with only minor adjustments made to enhance usability,
                                    accessibility, and overall user experience.

                                <button class="accordion-header">▷ Challenges and Strategies</button>

                                    The biggest challange for me is to creating the design and layout from scratch using
                                    only
                                    HTML and CSS. I think the coding part is relatively straightforward for me, and with
                                    the
                                    help of Gen AI tools, I can learn and implement the required codes. However, the
                                    design part
                                    is the most challenging for me, since I have to think about the layout, the
                                    placement of components,
                                    and other design elements all by myself. To overcome this challenge, I spent a lot
                                    of time
                                    looking for insiprations from other websites, design galleries like drbibble and
                                    behance, which are really helpful to spark my creativity and give me ideas on how to
                                    design the website.

                                    Another challange that I faced is the code structure and organization, especially
                                    when the
                                    codebase started to grow larger and a bit more complex, especially the css part.
                                    There are several times
                                    where I have an annoying bug because I have conflicting css rules or I accidentally
                                    override some styles that I have defined before.
                                    To overcome this challenge, I have adopted a more systematic approach to code
                                    organization, by creating small chunks
                                    of css components for each components, and also using more specific class names to
                                    avoid conflicts, as also reccommended in the studio activities.

                                    Overall, the accessibility audit results show that the website has been designed
                                    with accessibility in mind, with no critical issues found across all pages. There
                                    are minor issues in the Crumbings page in the items, as I have mentioned before, but
                                    other than that, all other pages have no critical issues.
