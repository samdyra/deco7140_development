                <p>
                    First off I just want to mention that I really enjoyed working this assignment 4. It was a really
                    it was a challanging yet fun experience to build a website end to end, from gathering the values,
                    needs, planning the features, learning to design ethical and accessible the UX/UI, and finally
                    implementing the website. Hats off to the teaching team for creating such an engaging and educative
                    course!

                                        From the client brief, the plugin includes several personal data that was not
                                        described how its going to be relevant with the goal of the project. Data such
                                        as annual income, credit cards, gender,spending habits, monthly dining
                                        expenditure
                                        will raise serious questions by the users regarding how the data will be used.
                                        According
                                        to the ACS principle of trustworthiness, professionals are ought to respect
                                        privacy and
                                        data confidentiality, especially personal data. The current data collected
                                        planned in the
                                        client brief are cleary appears unnecesarry and invasive.

                                    The client brief noted that the informations gathered from the form will help
                                    understand the users for future planning. After careful look, this argument has not
                                    been supported with some spesific explanation. This in turn will make it hard
                                    for us to justify to the users on why and how the data such as "spending habits"
                                    will be used, stored, or shared. The ACS Code mentioned that the importance of
                                    how we as a professional must maintain honesty in designing our products or
                                    services.
                                    Lack of clear disclosure on how we are going to use these personal data will
                                    raise high concerns to the users, and therefore might hinder user participation in
                                    the project.
