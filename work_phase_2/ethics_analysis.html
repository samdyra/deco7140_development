                    Honesty

                <h4>Rationale:</h4>
                <p>
                    "You will be honest in your representation of skills, knowledge, services and products."

                    <br />


                    Due to the functional requirement of this website that states the usage of a newsletter subscription
                    feature that requires user data input, several precautions must be made regarding the act of
                    collecting, managing, and sharing these personal data.
                </p>

                <div class="solution">
                    <h4>Solution:</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the solution in order to overcome this is to be as transparent to the user as possible.
                        Honesty and transparency to the user regarding data collection and management should be
                        mandatory,
                        This could be done by using several steps, including showing a clear and honest terms and
                        conditions,
                        having a feature to delete the user's own data, including their accounts, always shows
                        prompts
                        before any data collection activity occur, and make sure the website is still fully
                        functional
                        even in case the user do not intend to gave their permission for personal data collections.

                    The Primacy of the Public Interest

                <h4>Rationale:</h4>
                <p>
                    "You will place the interests of the public above those of personal, business or
                    sectional interests."
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Because the website created will host various cultures accross Australia, there will be risk of
                    giving
                    a certain preference to a certain groups, especially those who might have some commercial value.
                    This can lead to
                    bias in how each cultures represented.

                <div class="solution">
                    <h4>Solution:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The website created will have to keep fair representation, without any bias, and guarantee all
                        group of people and culture receive an equal chance and treatment, regardless of any economic
                        interests
                        or any other biases. In order to do this, a community representative should always be given the
                        chance
                        to advocate any mistreatment to the project's stakeholder. Furtheremore, a transparent
                        decision-making for
                        any changes created later down the road should be made mandatory, to maintain the website's
                        integrity by
                        preventing any potential public distrust from the users.

                    The Enhancement of Quality of Life

                    <br />
                    The risk of social harm will always exist in an social-media like softwares, as the website itself
                    will
                    encourage users to share their thoughts and ideas in any verbal communications. These expression,
                    will also allow social harms, such as profanity and cyber bullying to occur in the website, and
                    therefore
                    risking the quality of life to those who affected.

                    <p>
                        A proper content moderation system will be have to made to make sure we can minimize any social
                        harms.
                        Features such as community notes that is implemented in X (twitter) could also be implemented,
                        so that
                        human moderators trained in cultural sensitivity can assess any potential social harms
                        transparently.
                        Furthermore, a regular communication between the community and the stakeholder of this project
                        can also
                        help to speed up the feedback-improvement loop regarding any feature neccesarry to minimize
                        social harms.
