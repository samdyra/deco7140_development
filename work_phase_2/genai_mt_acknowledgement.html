                <h3>2. Context and Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    Because I have limited design and CSS skills, I mainly used Claude to generate some feedbacks on my
                    existing
                    design, so I could improve my styling.
                    Additionally, I use some Machine Translation tools such as Quillbot to improve my grammar and
                    overall english sentences.

                    The purpose of this AI/MT usage is to give me feedback and suggestions towards my existing work,
                    and therefore I still hold control over my own work.

                <h3>3. Critical Decision-Making and Ownership</h3>
                <p>
                    When improving my navbar, I make sure to try as best as possible first to create my own dekstop and
                    mobile navbar.
                    After that, I also try to look for inspirations on the internet first, and also learn the lecture
                    slides
                    regarding Visceral, Behavorial, and Reflective design. After having some understanding, then I went
                    to prompt the AI to help me find suggestions on how to improve my existing navbar. Even most of the
                    navbar styling given was very pretty,
                    most of the were very had to implement, and I could not understand the code. Therefore, rather than
                    copy paste the code, I try to learn the code given by the AI and implement the mobile navbar myself.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Similiar with the navbar, my card component (assessment-card) is also went through similiar
                    proccess.
                    First, I follow the design given from the applied class slides, and then improve it on my own, and
                    then
                    ask AI to give feedbacks. This way, the assessment card is still mostly handwritten by me.

                <h3>4. Accuracy, Bias, and Ethical Awareness</h3>
                <p>
                    I carefully reviewed all the genreated code by AI. Other than that, since my prompts are mostly
                    feedback related, and I also already have the original design, I did not copy pasted entire code
                    generated by AI, I only use several line of codes given whenever neccesesarry. I also make sure
                    all of the components still follows the color scheme and overall existing design layout that were
                    established before, and therefore the AI did not alter any ethical effect regarding the designs.

                <p>
                    Exploring the design, HTML, js, and css code given by the AI when asking for suggestions
                    is both scary and exciting. It's scary because it often shows me how little I know about
                    these things, but also exciting because that means theres still lot more to learn.

                    The usage of AI in this assessment also taught me a little about CSS in general, like
                    CSS debugging and syntaxes.

                <p>
                    I used these AI/MT tools to support and supplement my learning and work in this work phase 2.
                    All generated code, suggestions, and feedbacks were critically reviewed and adapted based on
                    my own needs and also the ethical considerations. I ensure the final work given reflects my
                    understandinga
                    and capabilities.
