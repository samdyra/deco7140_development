                <h3>2. Context and Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    Because I have limited design and CSS skills, I mainly used Claude to generate some feedbacks on my
                    existing
                    design, so I could improve my styling.
                    Additionally, I use some Machine Translation tools such as Quillbot to improve my grammar and
                    overall english sentences.

                    The purpose of this AI/MT usage is to give me feedback and suggestions towards my existing work,
                    and therefore I still hold control over my own work.

                </p>

                <h3>3. Critical Decision-Making and Ownership</h3>
                <p>
                    When improving my navbar, I make sure to try as best as possible first to create my own dekstop and
                    mobile navbar.
                    After that, I also try to look for inspirations on the internet first, and also learn the lecture
                    slides
                    regarding Visceral, Behavorial, and Reflective design. After having some understanding, then I went
                    to prompt the AI to help me find suggestions on how to improve my existing navbar. Even most of the
                    navbar styling given was very pretty,
                    most of the were very had to implement, and I could not understand the code. Therefore, rather than
                    copy paste the code, I try to learn the code given by the AI and implement the mobile navbar myself.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Similiar with the navbar, my card component (assessment-card) is also went through similiar
                    proccess.
                    First, I follow the design given from the applied class slides, and then improve it on my own, and
                    then
                    ask AI to give feedbacks. This way, the assessment card is still mostly handwritten by me.
