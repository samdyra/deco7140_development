                <p>
                    Briefly explain the purpose of the task and what you were trying to achieve with the help of
                    AI Tools — or what guided your decision not to use them.
                    “I used Claude to generate an outline for my report so I could compare it to my own
                    initial structure and improve flow between sections.”

                <h3>3. Critical Decision-Making and Ownership</h3>
                <p>
                    Explain how you stayed in control of the process and made informed decisions about what
                    to keep, change, or reject. Show how your final submission reflects your authorship.
                    “I rewrote the AI-generated paragraph to improve technical accuracy and match the
                    tone of the client. The suggestion was useful as a starting point, but not appropriate
                    as written.”
                    “I commented each section of code generated by Copilot to verify my understanding
                    before adapting the logic to my own HTML structure.”

                <p>
                    Demonstrate how you verified information and ensured the content was accurate, inclusive,
                    and appropriate for your audience.
                    “The AI suggested a leaderboard feature, but I rejected this because it conflicted with
                    user privacy concerns identified in my interviews.”
                    “I double-checked definitions provided by [AI Tool] against official documentation and
                    amended those that were overly simplified or misleading.”

                <p>
                    Show that you avoided entering confidential or identifiable information in your prompts.
                    “Before using ChatGPT to generate summary bullet points, I stripped all names and
                    personal details from user quotes.”

                <p>
                    Reflect on how AI Tool use (or your decision not to use them) supported your learning and
                    understanding of the task.
                    “Exploring AI-generated examples helped me think more clearly about accessibility
                    trade-offs, even though I didn’t use the final outputs directly.”

                    Close your acknowledgment with a clear integrity statement that affirms your responsible
                    use and ownership of the final submission.
                    “I used [AI Tool] to support my learning by generating alternative ideas and refining
                    structure. All outputs were critically reviewed, adapted where appropriate, and
                    integrated thoughtfully. I maintained control and ensured that all final work reflected
                    my understanding and capabilities.”
