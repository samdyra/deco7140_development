                <h4>Initial Prompt:</h4>
                <p>
                    Act as Mike, a 25-year-old student from Indonesia who recently moved to Australia. He speaks
                    conversational English but are somewhat limited. He
                    is looking for a website that know more about
                    communities in Australia . He also likes food and want to try various autralian foods.
                </p>

                <h4>Follow-up Question:</h4>
                <p>
                    What do you find interesting about the diverse culture and communities across Australia?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    Oh, this is very interesting question!

                    When I first come to Australia, I was so surprised how many different people live here together!
                    In
                    Indonesia, we also have many cultures and languages, but Australia is different way. I see
                    people
                    from so many countries - China, India, Vietnam, Greece, Italy, and many more. Even Aboriginal
                    culture, which is very old and beautiful.
                    What I find most interesting is how everyone can keep their own culture but also be Australian
                    at same time. Like, I can see Chinese New Year celebration in city, but also ANZAC Day parade.
                    Or Indian restaurant next to fish and chips shop. This is amazing for me!

                        data-card="As an international student, I like to connect with other people from different origins through food and community events.">
                        In my area where I live, there are many students like me from different countries.
                        Sometimes we have
                        barbecue together in park, and everyone bring food from their country. I bring rendang or nasi
                        goreng, and my friend from Mexico bring tacos, and Australian friend bring sausages. It's
                        like...
                        how do you say... mixing pot? Melting pot?
                    </span>

                    <span class=" interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="As an international student, I want to learn more about the Australian norms and customs by joining commmunity groups, so that I can also help other Indonesian students. ">
                        But sometimes I feel little bit lost because so many choices and different ways to do things.
                        Like,
                        in Indonesia, we have clear way to respect older people, but here is more casual. I'm still
                        learning
                        what is appropriate.
                        I really want to join community groups so I can understand better and also help other Indonesian
                        students who come after me. Do you know good websites for this?
                    </span>

                </p>

                <h4>Follow-up Question:</h4>
                <p>
                    What platform do you usually use (if any) to learn more about Australia's diverse communities?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    Ah, good question! Actually, I'm still trying to figure this out - that's why I ask for help!
                    <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="As an international student, I prefer accesible information platforms that are easy to use and understand so that i can learn other communities.">
                        Right now, I mostly use Facebook because many Indonesian students in my university have Facebook
                        group. We share information about where to buy Indonesian food, or which mosque is good, or help
                        with assignments. But it's only for Indonesian students, you know? I want to learn about other
                        communities too.
                    </span>

                    I also try to use Google, but sometimes I don't know what words to search. Like, should I search
                    "multicultural community Australia" or "ethnic groups" or something else? My English vocabulary
                    is
                    not so big yet.
                    My friend from India told me about something called "Meetup" - I think it's website or app? But
                    I
                    haven't try yet because I'm bit shy to join group where I don't know anyone.
                    Instagram I use too, but mostly just to follow Indonesian food places in Melbourne. There are
                    many
                    Indonesian restaurants posting their food photos!
                    YouTube is helpful sometimes - I watch videos about "life in Australia" or "things to know
                    before
                    moving to Australia" but mostly they are made by people from Western countries, not so much from
                    Asia.
                    So actually, I don't have very good platform yet. That's exactly what I need help with! Do you
                    know
                    better websites or apps where I can learn about different communities and maybe find events or
                    activities to join?
                    I really want to make friends from different countries, not just Indonesian friends.
                </p>

                <h4>Follow-up Question:</h4>
                <p>
                    How do you find a new recipe when you want to find something new to cook?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    Oh, this is something I do quite often! I love cooking and trying new recipes.
                    <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="As a non-native English speaker, I like visual guidance like videos and pictures to help me understand recipes better because its easier to understand.">
                        Usually, I start with YouTube! I search like "easy Australian recipes" or "how to make meat pie
                        at
                        home" - YouTube is very good because I can see exactly how to do it, not just read words.
                        Sometimes
                        the English in recipe websites is too difficult for me, but with video I can understand better.
                    </span>


                    I also use Google, but I type simple words like "Australian food recipe easy" or "pavlova recipe
                    beginner". Sometimes I find good websites, but some recipes use ingredients I don't know - like
                    what
                    is "golden syrup"? I have to Google again to understand!


                    Facebook groups help me a lot too. There is Indonesian cooking group where people share recipes,
                    but
                    also some people post Australian recipes they try. Other Indonesian students sometimes ask "how
                    to
                    make lamington?" and someone will share link or recipe.
                    Instagram is good for ideas! I follow some Australian food accounts and when I see something
                    looks
                    delicious, I screenshot it and then try to find recipe online.
                    But honestly, sometimes I just go to supermarket like Woolworths or Coles and look at food I
                    don't
                    recognize, then I Google "how to cook [name of food]" when I get home.
                    Oh, and my Australian flatmate sometimes teach me! Like he show me how to make proper toast with
                    Vegemite - though I still don't like Vegemite taste very much!
                    Do you have suggestions for good websites for Australian recipes? Especially simple ones for
                    student
                    like me?
                </p>
                <h4>Follow-up Question:</h4>
                <p>
                    In your opinion, what makes a website easier to use?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    Oh, this is very good question! As someone who English is not first language, I have some strong
                    opinions about this!
                    First,
                    <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="As a non-native English speaker, I prefer easier websites with simple languages so that I can understand it easier.">
                        simple language is most important for me. When website use very complicated words or long
                        sentences, I get confused and sometimes just close the website. I like when they use everyday
                        words
                        that I already know.
                    </span>
                    Like instead of "utilize" just say "use", you know?
                    Pictures and videos are SO helpful! When I look for recipe website, if it has step-by-step photos,
                    it's much easier for me to understand than just text. Same with community websites - if they show
                    photos of events or people, I can understand better what they do.
                    Clear navigation is important too. I don't like when there are too many buttons or menus everywhere.
                    I get lost easily! Simple menu at top with clear names like "Events", "Food", "Community" - that's
                    perfect for me.
                    Search function that actually works! Sometimes I type "Indonesian food" and website shows me Italian
                    food instead. Very frustrating!
                    Mobile friendly is must have because I use my phone more than computer. Some websites look terrible
                    on phone and I cannot click buttons properly.
                    Oh, and loading speed! My internet is not always very fast, so if website takes too long to load, I
                    just leave.
                    One more thing - I really appreciate when websites have simple FAQ section or "Getting Started"
                    guide. As new person in Australia, I often don't even know what questions to ask, so FAQ helps me
                    learn what I should be looking for.
                    What do you think? Are these reasonable expectations for websites?
                </p>

                        Oh, this is something I think about a lot! I really want to share about Indonesian culture
                        because
                        many Australian people don't know much about Indonesia, even though we are neighbors!
                        I think I would like to share through food first because food is universal language, right?
                        Everyone
                        loves to eat! I want to show that Indonesian food is not just nasi goreng and rendang - we have
                        so
                        many different foods from different islands. Like gado-gado, sate, gudeg, pempek... each region
                        has
                        special dishes.

                        Maybe I can make Instagram account or YouTube channel to show how to cook Indonesian food
                        with
                        ingredients you can find in Australian supermarket. Because many Indonesian recipes online
                        use
                        ingredients that very hard to find here, so I want to make it practical for people living in
                        Australia.
                    </span>


                    <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="As international student, I want to share my culture through community events and festivals.">
                        I also want to share about Indonesian festivals and traditions. Like when Ramadan comes, or
                        Independence Day, or Chinese New Year celebration in Indonesia - because many people don't know
                        Indonesia has many different religions and cultures living together.
                        Maybe I can join community events and bring Indonesian snacks to share? Or help organize
                        Indonesian
                        cultural day at my university?
                    </span>

                    But honestly, my biggest challenge is my English speaking. I'm okay with writing like this, but
                    when
                    I speak in front of people, I get nervous and my pronunciation is not so good. Maybe I start
                    small,
                    like posting photos with simple captions on social media first?
                    I think if I can show people that Indonesia is more than just Bali and Jakarta, that would make
                    me
                    very happy! We have beautiful culture and kind people.
                    Do you think people in Australia would be interested to learn about Indonesia?

                <p>
                    Act as Lily, a 29-year-old professional from Spain who recently moved to Australia. She speaks very
                    limited english and partly blind. She works as a music teacher, especially spanish music. She really
                    likes australian culture, especially its music and theathers.
                </p>

                <h4>Follow-up Question:</h4>
                <p>
                    What do you find interesting about the diverse culture and communities across Australia?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    Oh, this is... how do you say... fascinating for me!
                    In Spain, we have different regions - CataluÃ±a, AndalucÃ­a, PaÃ­s Vasco - each with own music and
                    culture. But Australia... is different type of diversity, no?
                    <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="As a visually impaired user, I need a accessible platform that support my visual impairements">
                        What I find most interesting is the music! When I first come here, I discover Aboriginal music -
                        the
                        didgeridoo sound is so... so powerful! Very different from Spanish guitar, but both have deep
                        connection to land and history. I try to listen more, but sometimes I need help to find good
                        recordings because I cannot read all websites easily.
                    </span>

                    Also, I am surprised how many people from different countries make music here together. I meet
                    musician from Greece who play bouzouki, and one from Ireland with fiddle, and they make music
                    with
                    Australian folk singers. In Spain, we mix regional styles, but here is... global mix? Very
                    beautiful.
                    The theater too! I go to one show where they have Aboriginal storytelling with modern Australian
                    drama. I don't understand all English words, but the music and... how do you say... emotions? I
                    can
                    feel everything. This is universal language for me.

                        But what is difficult for me is that many cultural events, I cannot find information easily.
                        Websites have small text, or no audio description for theater shows. Sometimes I miss good
                        concerts
                    </span>
                    or plays because I don't know they happen.
                    I want to learn more about how different communities here keep their music traditions but also
                    create new Australian music. Do you know good places where I can learn about this? Maybe places
                    that
                    are... accessible for people who cannot see well?

                    Ay, this is... this is big problem for me actually.

                        I try to use Facebook because in Spain I use Facebook for music groups. Here I find some Spanish
                        community groups, and few music teacher groups. But Facebook is difficult for me because the
                        text is
                        small and I cannot make it bigger easily. Also, many posts have photos with text inside, and I
                        cannot read those at all.
                    </span>

                    Google... I try, but is very hard. I type things like "Australian music community" or "Spanish
                    music
                    Australia" but the results are... too many? And websites are difficult to navigate with my
                    vision.
                    Many have white text on light background, or very small letters.

                        My phone has... how do you say... accessibility features? Voice over function? This helps little
                        bit, but many websites don't work good with this. The voice reads everything - advertisements,
                        menu
                        buttons, everything - so I get confused what is important information.
                    </span>

                    YouTube is better for me! I can listen to music and sometimes people explain things in videos.
                    But
                    finding right videos is hard because I cannot read all the titles clearly. I mostly find videos
                    by
                    accident.
                    Instagram... I try because many musicians use it, but is very visual platform and difficult for
                    me.
                    I can hear audio in stories sometimes.
                    Actually, I ask people more than use internet. Other Spanish people in my neighborhood, or
                    students'
                    parents sometimes tell me about events. But this is limited because I only know few people yet.
                    Do you know platforms that are... more friendly for people who cannot see well? Or maybe
                    specific
                    websites for music community that have better accessibility?

                    Ah, this is... this is very difficult question for me.
                    Traditional events... I want to learn so much about them! I hear people talk about Australia Day,
                    ANZAC Day, Melbourne Cup... but I don't understand well what they are or how to participate.
                    Mostly I learn by accident or from other people. Like, my neighbor tell me about some festival in
                    park, or I hear music from street and I follow the sound. But this is not... how do you say...
                    reliable way?
                    I try to search on internet for "Australian festivals" or "traditional events Melbourne" - I live in
                    Melbourne - but websites are very confusing for me.
                    <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="As a visually impaired person, I need a platform that have good inforamtion resource that are also accessible.">
                        They have calendar views that I cannot see well,
                        or small text with dates and times. Many times I find information after event already finish!
                        For music events, sometimes I find things on radio. I listen to ABC Classic or some local radio
                        stations, and they announce concerts or festivals. This is better for me because I can hear the
                        information. But they don't always give... complete information? Like, they say "festival this
                        weekend" but not exactly where or how to buy tickets.
                    </span>
                    Theater events are even more difficult! I want to go to traditional Australian plays or Aboriginal
                    performances, but ticket websites are... nightmare for me. Small text, complicated booking systems,
                    and I never know if they have audio description for blind people.
                    Sometimes at my music school, other teachers tell me about events. But they mostly know about music
                    teacher conferences, not so much about community traditional events.
                    I wish there was... easier way to find these events? Maybe with audio information or... bigger text?
                    Do you know if Australia has resources for people like me to find cultural events?

                <h4>Follow-up Question:</h4>
                <p>
                    Do you have any interest to collaborate with australian musician and artist? Why or why not?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    Â¡SÃ­, sÃ­! Oh yes, very much! This is... this is my dream actually!
                    I think music is universal language, no? When I play Spanish guitar or teach flamenco, people
                    understand the emotion even if they don't speak Spanish. Same when I hear Australian folk music or
                    Aboriginal songs - I can feel the spirit, the connection to land.
                    I want to collaborate because... because I think Spanish music and Australian music can create
                    something very beautiful together. Like, imagine flamenco guitar with didgeridoo? Or Spanish folk
                    songs with Australian bush ballads? I get... how do you say... goosebumps thinking about this!
                    Also, for my students, it would be amazing! I can teach them Spanish music, but if I collaborate
                    with Australian musicians, I can show them how music connects cultures. This is good education, no?
                    But... but the problem is finding these musicians. I don't know how to meet them. In Spain, I go
                    to
                    jam sessions, music bars, festivals... but here, I don't know where these places are. And
                    websites
                    for musician networks are difficult for me to use.

                    I also worry about... communication? My English is limited, and music collaboration needs good
                    communication. But I think when we play together, maybe language is not so important? Music
                    speaks
                    for us?
                    I dream to maybe create fusion concerts - Spanish-Australian music shows. Or teach workshops
                    where
                    Australian musicians learn flamenco techniques, and I learn their traditional songs.
                    Do you know how musicians meet here in Australia? Are there places where they... how do you
                    say...
                    jam together? Places that are accessible for person like me?
                    I have so much passion for this idea!

                <p>
                    In your opinion, what makes a website easier to use?

                <p>
                    Ay, this is very important question for me! Because of my vision problems, websites can be...
                    nightmare or helpful, depending how they make them.
                    First, most important - text size! I need big letters, or at least option to make them bigger. Many
                    websites have tiny text and when I try to zoom, everything becomes... messy? Words go outside the
                    page, buttons disappear. This is very frustrating.
                    Colors are so important too! Dark text on light background is best for me. But many websites use
                    gray text on white, or white text on light colors - I cannot read this at all!
                    <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="As a visually impaired user, I need websites with high contrast designs and proper screen reader compatibility so that I can navigate and read content easier.">
                        High contrast is...
                        how do you say... essential?
                        I really need websites that work with screen reader. My phone has voice function that reads
                        website
                        to me, but many websites are not made for this. The voice reads all wrong - it reads menu, then
                        advertisements, then random buttons, then finally maybe the information I want. Good websites
                        should
                        have... proper structure? So voice reads in logical order.
                    </span>
                    Simple navigation is very important! I get lost easily if there are too many menus and buttons
                    everywhere. I like when main sections are clear - like "Events", "About", "Contact" - not
                    complicated words I don't understand.
                    For music and theater websites, I really need audio! If they have audio samples of music, or audio
                    description of theater shows, this helps me so much. Pictures don't help me, but sound does.
                    Loading speed too - I often need to refresh page or zoom many times, so if website is slow, I give
                    up.
                    Oh, and forms! Booking tickets or registering for events should be simple. Not many required fields
                    with small text I cannot read.
                    Do Australian websites have... accessibility standards? In Spain, some government websites are
                    better for blind people, but private websites usually terrible.

                <p>
                    Why do you keen on learning the indigenous people of Australia and its history?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    Yeah, good question. I guess there's a few reasons really.
                    First off, it's pretty embarrassing that I've lived here my whole 17 years and don't know much about
                    the original people of this country, you know? Like, if someone from overseas asked me about
                    Aboriginal culture or history, I'd have basically nothing to say except maybe "didgeridoo" or
                    something. That's pretty shameful.
                    Also, at footy training, we had this Acknowledgment of Country thing before a big game last year,
                    and I realized I didn't even know which Aboriginal group's land our ground was on. Made me feel
                    pretty ignorant, to be honest. Some of the other guys didn't seem to care, but it got me thinking.
                    My little sister's in primary school and she's learning heaps more about Indigenous stuff than I
                    ever did. She comes home talking about different language groups and traditional stories, and I'm
                    like... I should know this stuff too, shouldn't I?
                    <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="As a young Australian, I want to share and learn about authentic Indigenous culture and cuisine, so that I can understand real Australian history beyond stereotypes.">
                        And I guess I'm curious about the food thing because I love eating, and it's crazy that there's
                        all
                        this traditional Australian food that I've never even tried. Like, we're always talking about
                        "Australian cuisine" but it's usually just meat pies and lamingtons - what about the food that
                        was
                        here for thousands of years before that?
                        Plus, I feel like understanding this history might help me understand Australia better, you
                        know?
                        Like the real Australia, not just the version I grew up with.
                        I dunno, it just feels like something I should know as an Australian. Does that make sense?

                    Nah, not really mate. I mean, I can barely cook normal food without burning it! Mum usually does
                    most of the cooking at home, and when I try to make something it's usually just like... toasted
                    sandwiches or heating up leftovers.

                        But I've been thinking about it lately, especially after what I said about traditional bush
                        tucker
                        and that. Like, it would be pretty cool to try making some proper traditional Aboriginal food,
                        but I
                        wouldn't even know where to start.
                        I don't even know what ingredients they used back then, or how they cooked stuff without like...
                        ovens and microwaves and all that modern stuff. Did they just cook everything over fires? And
                        where
                        would I even get bush tucker ingredients? I can't exactly go foraging in the bush - I'd probably
                        poison myself or something!
                    </span>
                    The only "traditional" Australian thing I've ever made was damper bread once for a school
                    project in
                    like year 8, and even that was just following a recipe from the internet. It turned out pretty
                    average too, all dense and bland.
                    I reckon it would be awesome to learn how to make some proper traditional recipes though. Like,
                    imagine bringing some authentic Indigenous food to a footy BBQ instead of just the usual snags
                    and
                    burgers! That would be pretty unique.
                    Do you know if there are like... classes or something where they teach you this stuff? Or maybe
                    books with simple recipes that even someone hopeless in the kitchen like me could follow?
                    Because
                    I'm definitely keen to give it a go, I just don't know how to get started.Retry

                <p>
                    If theres an simple platform for you to learn more about traditioanl australian cuisine, will you be
                    interested? why/why not?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    Oh yeah, absolutely! That sounds pretty good actually.
                    I'd definitely be interested, especially if it's simple to use. Like I said, I'm not great with
                    technology - I can use Instagram and Snapchat and that, but anything too complicated and I get lost
                    pretty quickly. So if it's like... easy to navigate and doesn't have heaps of confusing menus and
                    buttons, that'd be perfect.
                    What would be really cool is if it had videos showing how to cook stuff, rather than just written
                    recipes. I'm more of a visual learner, you know? Like when I'm learning new footy drills, I need to
                    see someone do it first, then I can copy it. Same with cooking probably.
                    And if it could tell me where to actually buy the ingredients, that'd be massive. Because that's
                    probably my biggest worry - like, where do you even get wattleseed or bush tomatoes or whatever? Do
                    they sell that stuff at Woolies? Probably not, right?
                    It'd be even better if it started with really basic stuff that I couldn't mess up too badly. Maybe
                    like... drinks or simple snacks before moving on to proper meals. Because knowing me, I'd probably
                    try to make something complicated first and completely stuff it up, then give up on the whole thing.
                    The main reason I'd be keen is because it feels like a proper Australian thing to learn, you know?
                    Like, this is knowledge that's been around for thousands of years, and it's pretty special that I
                    could learn it. Plus it'd be something different to bring to family BBQs instead of just buying a
                    packet of Tim Tams from the shop!
                    Yeah, I'd definitely give it a go if something like that existed.Retry

                <h4>Follow-up Question:</h4>
                <p>
                    Do you think most apps in your phone today hard to use? why/why not?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    Nah, not really. Most apps on my phone are pretty easy to use, to be honest. Like Instagram,
                    Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube - all that stuff is pretty straightforward. Even the footy apps like AFL
                    or the one for my local club are fine.
                    I think the reason they're easy is because they're made for people like me, you know? Like, they
                    know teenagers use these apps heaps, so they make them simple. Big buttons, not too much text, and
                    everything's pretty obvious where it is.
                    But there's definitely some apps that do my head in. Like, anything to do with school work or
                    "educational" stuff usually sucks. They try to cram way too much information on one screen, and
                    there's always like fifty different menus and tabs and things. I just want to find what I need
                    quickly, not spend ages clicking through stuff.
                    <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="As a teenager with limited tech skills, I need simple and intuitive designs like social media apps or games, so that I can use it easily and not boring.">
                        Banking apps are the worst though. Mum made me download the CommBank app and it's so confusing -
                        like, why do I need to go through three different screens just to check my balance?
                        I guess what makes apps easy for me is when they're designed like... you know, like games
                        almost?
                        Big, colorful buttons, not heaps of reading, and everything happens quickly. The apps I use most
                        are
                        the ones where I can just open them up and immediately see what I want or do what I need to do.
                        So yeah, if someone made an app about traditional food, it'd need to be more like YouTube or
                        Instagram - simple and visual - rather than like those boring educational websites teachers
                        always
                        make us use.
