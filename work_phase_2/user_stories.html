                <strong>Initial Prompt:</strong> Can you tell me about a time when you felt a strong sense of community?
                What made that experience memorable for you?
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                <strong>Follow-up Question:</strong> How do you think technology can enhance or hinder the sense of
                community in today's world?

            </p>
            <p class="response">
                <strong>Response:</strong> I remember a local festival in my neighborhood where everyone came together
                to celebrate our diverse cultures. <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" data-card="
                    This experience was unforgettable 
                ">It was
                    memorable because it wasn't just about the event itself, but
                    the way people interacted, shared stories, and supported each other </span>. Technology can enhance
                community
                by connecting people who might not otherwise meet, but it can also hinder it if it leads to superficial
                interactions or replaces face-to-face connections.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                <strong>Follow-up Question:</strong> What features would you like to see in a community-focused website
                that would make it more engaging and useful for you?
            </p>
            <p class="response">
                <strong>Response:</strong> I would love to see features like event calendars, forums
                for discussions, and resource sharing sections. <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" data-card="
                    These features would help me stay informed and connected
