                <h3>Interview 1: Blake</h3>

                <h4>Initial Prompt:</h4>
                <p>
                    Can you tell me about a time when you felt a strong sense of community?
                    What made that experience memorable for you?
                </p>

                <h4>Follow-up Question:</h4>
                <p>
                    How do you think technology can enhance or hinder the sense of
                    community in today's world?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    I remember a local festival in my neighborhood where everyone came together
                    to celebrate our diverse cultures. <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" data-card="
                        This experience was unforgettable 
                    ">It was
                        memorable because it wasn't just about the event itself, but
                        the way people interacted, shared stories, and supported each other</span>. Technology can
                    enhance
                    community
                    by connecting people who might not otherwise meet, but it can also hinder it if it leads to
                    superficial
                    interactions or replaces face-to-face connections.
                </p>

                <h4>Follow-up Question:</h4>
                <p>
                    What features would you like to see in a community-focused website
                    that would make it more engaging and useful for you?
                </p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>
                    I would love to see features like event calendars, forums
                    for discussions, and resource sharing sections. <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="
                        These features would help me stay informed and connected
                    ">They would make the website more engaging and useful by providing
                        practical tools for interaction and information exchange</span>.
