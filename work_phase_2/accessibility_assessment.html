                <h3>1. Consistent Navigation (AA)</h3>
                <h4>Success Criteria:</h4>
                <p>
                    Navigation mechanisms (changing pages) within a web page must have the same relative
                    order and structure, unless the user itself deliberately changes it.
                </p>
                <h4>Implementation on my website:</h4>
                <p>
                    I will use it on my website because the website I create will contain multiple pages
                    and each of them have different content. Therefore, the consistent navigation UI and
                    mechanism will make the website easier to be navigated by the user. In order to do
                    this, I will create one navigation bar, and use it for every page I created.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Consistent Identification (Level AA)</h3>
                <h4>Success Criteria:</h4>
                <p>
                    Part of the websites that have the same function within the website must be identified in the same
                    way.
                </p>
                <h4>Implementation on my website:</h4>
                <p>
                    I will use the same color scheme and UI components for the same type of content, for example
                    using the same color for all the headings and the same colors/shapes for all the buttons.
                    Furtheremore,
                    I believe some features such as thread/timeline will be usable in many places, and applying
                    this consistent identification will make the app easier for the user to use, and also make the
                    development faster too since I dont have to make the same things twice.

                <h3>3. Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)</h3>
                <h4>Success Criteria:</h4>
                <p>
                    The UI within the application should have a certain level of contrast compared to the background.
                </p>
                <h4>Implementation on my website:</h4>
                <p>
                    I will create a proper color scheme that has a good contrast ratio between the colors. Furtheremore,
                    I will make sure the usage of this color scheme is appropriate too, by creating UI components that
                    follow this color scheme. Therefore the rest of the app will all have good contrast ratio, as long
                    it use the UI components.
