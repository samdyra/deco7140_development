                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>
                    We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering
                    social cohesion by <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" data-card="Value 1">empowering
                        diverse communities to share
                        their stories, connect with others
                        , and access resources </span>
                    that enhance their visibility and influence. Our mission is
                    to strengthen societal bonds by creating platforms that
                    celebrate and support the unique identities of communities
                    across Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams
                    at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is
                    tasked with developing individual concepts and prototypes
                    for dynamic websites that align with CCI's mission and
                    vision. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by
                    creating platforms that celebrate and support the unique
                    identities of communities across Australia.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We are commissioning the development of dynamic,
                    user-friendly websites that represent and <span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="Value 2"> support different
                        communities</span>. Each website should serve as a central hub
                    where community members can share resources, highlight
                    events, and foster meaningful connections.<span class="interactive-highlight-stories"
                        data-card="Value 2">The websites must
                        not include any form of commercial activity, such as
                        advertising or selling products. However, it is acceptable
                        to promote resources, events, or services that are directly
                        beneficial to the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and
                    reflect the diverse needs of the selected community focus
                    area while adhering to our mission of inclusivity,
                    accessibility, and ethical design. Each website should also
                    celebrate the unique characteristics of its chosen community
                    and support meaningful interaction and engagement.
                </p>

                <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Community Members: Individuals within the selected
                        community who seek representation, resources, and
                        connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        General Audience: Broader society, who can use the
                        website to learn about the community and its
                        contributions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Accessibility must be prioritised to ensure seamless
                    interaction for all users, including those relying on
                    assistive technologies.
                </p>

                        community, recognising and representing the diversity
                        within the community rather than relying on stereotypes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide clear, accessible information and resources to

                    </li>
                    <li>
