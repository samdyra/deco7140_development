                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>
                    We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering
                    social cohesion by empowering diverse communities to share
                    their stories, <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" data-card="Value 1">connect with others
                    </span>,
                    and
                    access resources
                    that enhance their visibility and influence. Our mission is
                    to strengthen societal bonds by creating platforms that
                    celebrate and support the unique identities of communities
                    across Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams
                    Week 5: Design Research | Creating your Client Needs Analysis Web Page
                    at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is
                    tasked with developing individual concepts and prototypes
                    for dynamic websites that align with CCI's mission and
                    vision. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by
                    creating platforms that celebrate and support the unique
                    identities of communities across Australia.

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We are commissioning the development of dynamic,
                    user-friendly websites that represent and support different
                    communities. Each website should serve as a central hub
                    where community members can share resources, highlight
                    events, and foster meaningful connections. The websites must
                    not include any form of commercial activity, such as
                    advertising or selling products. However, it is acceptable
                    to promote resources, events, or services that are directly
                    beneficial to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and
                    reflect the diverse needs of the selected community focus
                    area while adhering to our mission of inclusivity,
                    accessibility, and ethical design. Each website should also
                    celebrate the unique characteristics of its chosen community
                    and support meaningful interaction and engagement.
                </p>

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>

                    assistive technologies.
