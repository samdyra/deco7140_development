                        As planned on the sitemap, this part of screen is consisting of 3 main features, landing page, highlights, and about. Firstly, in the landing page, I used the Gestalt Principles, Law of Prägnanz. I use simple texts with buttons, basic shapes, and a simple background. To make sure I adhere to contrast minimum (WCAG 1.4.3), I do not plan on using an image for the background. I intend to use a minimum decorations to fill the white space in the landing page. This too also following the Gestalt principle of Figure and Ground, which is to make sure the main contents stand out to the background. Moving on to next section which is the highlight, I actually put it very near to to the landing page, so that the user can see the highlight from the first time when opening the page, making it easier and hopefully acts as a hook for the user. In order to make sure its not cluttered, i apply the Gestalt Principles of Common Regions. I boxed in the highlight section using border so that the separation of the contents clearer. Lastly, the about page is provided near the bottom of the page. Identical to the other sections, because there is images in this part, I will make sure to apply alt text in order to adhere WCAG 1.1.1 (alt text for non-text content). Overall, I also apply Gestalt Principles of Proximity, and Gestalt Principles of Similarity by using consistent spacing between things that are connected and non-connected, and consistent designs such for buttons, text, and colors (later on design implementation). Mobile specific: Some of the components layouts are changed (for example row become columns), in order to maintain consistent spacings and prevent cluttering.

                    I chose a more professional but still modern font, in order to balance out some "gamification" parts
                    of the website. For the text sizes, I used the The Golden Ratio theory to make visual hierarchy
                    (headings - sub headings - text and so on) just feels "right" and balanced. Also, the colors and
                    font weights used for the texts is also considering the contrast ratio (WCAG 1.4.3) to make sure the
                    texts and background is easily contrast enough. By default, I use line-height of 1.6 to make sure
                    the easily track one line to another while still maintaining appropiate spacing. But, for headings,
                    I use line-height of 1.2 to make sure the headings is more compact and stands out more.
