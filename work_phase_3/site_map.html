                                        Crumbs is like a tweet in Twitter, or a post in Facebook, but in this case, it
                                        is a way for people to represent their community and connect with others by
                                        sharing general text-based posts, traditional cuisines
                                        recipes, and/or events such as "Cooking party" or "Traditional

                                        crumblings.

                                        Based on all all the interviewee response, Food especially traditional cuisines,
                                        without a doubt is one thing in common that can help people connect with their
                                        community, or even others. Resonated by the user stories, food is one of the
                                        things that people can easily relate to, and subsquently acts as a form of
                                        cultural expression. Furtheremore, this is also resonated in the user needs in
                                        Value 1 and 3, more
                                        specifically, users wants to express their culture through cuisines, and also a
                                        platform to connect with others.

                                        Based on the user stories, some interviewee especially non-native Australians
                                        want to learn about the Australian traditional cuisines, and also want to share
                                        their own traditional cuisines. This acts as an opportunity to create
                                        connections, and therefore the crumblings page is created to answer these needs.

                                        <br />
                                        <br />

                                        Referring back to user stories, an interviewee mentioned that a gamified
                                        platform can help to make the platform more engaging and fun to use. Therefore,
                                        A harmless gamification is created in order to encourage users to create and
                                        share their crumblings (traditional cuisines), and also their "attempt" to cook
                                        those crumblings. It works this way, Community can create their own crumblings
                                        recipe, based on the community representation itself. Then, other users
                                        can try to cook the recipe, and share their attempt by posting a photo of
                                        their cooked recipe, along with their experience and story about the recipe.
                                        There will be two leaderboard, the crumblings that has the most cooked attempts,
                                        and also the user that has the most reviewed and cooked attempts (Called
                                        Chef). As imagined, each of these crumblings attempts can be interacted,
                                        commented, and shared.

                                        could be a cultural community, a hobby based community, or even a location based

                                                be taken to remove the community if necessary.

                                                important to make sure
