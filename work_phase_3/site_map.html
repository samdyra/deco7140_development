                                        Food especially traditional cuisines, without a doubt is one strong pillar of
                                        culture. Resonated by the user stories, food is one of the things that people
                                        can easily relate to, and subsquently acts as a form of cultural expression.
                                        Based on the needs that we identified, users especially non-native Australians
                                        want to learn about the Australian traditional cuisines, and also want to share
                                        their own traditional cuisines. This acts as an opportunity to create
                                        connections, and therefore the crumblings page is created to answer these needs.

                                        <br />

                                        A harmless gamification is created in order to encourage users to create and
                                        share their crumblings (traditional cuisines), and also their "attempt" to cook
                                        those crumblings. It works this way, Community can create their own crumblings
                                        recipe, in accordance with the community representation. Then, other users
                                        can try to cook the recipe, and share their attempt by posting a photo of
                                        their cooked recipe, along with their experience and story about the recipe.
                                        There will be two leaderboard, the crumblings that has the most cooked attempts,
                                        and also the user that has the most reviewed and cooked attempts (Called
                                        Chef). As imagined, each of these crumblings attempts can be interacted,
                                        commented, and shared.

                                        "Meaningful Connections" exists when we feel like home. A sense of belonging,
                                        and
                                        being accepted with people and community around us is the foundation of creating
                                        a
                                        "meaningful" connection. Creating and joining community events is one way to
                                        connect.
                                        In doing so, this feature is created to create "homes" for people to join,
                                        share, and
                                        connect with others in their community through OZvents.

                                        Cultural representation and celebration starts with knowing, acknowledging, and
                                        learning about
                                        the community itself. This feature is created to answer the need to express
                                        or share traditional communities, and also providing learning materials. Through
                                        Lores (A simple Wiki for each community), people can
                                        learn about the community, their history, culture, and other relevant
                                        information.

                                        <br />

                                        The communities and Ozvents page is created to answer these values and needs. A
                                        comprehensive list of communities made by users, and also the OZvents associated
                                        with the communities
                                        will be easily accessible for the the users. Users can create, join, and share
                                        communities and OZvents to connect with others in their community.

                                        To not limit the way people can be a community, there is no definitive "type of
                                        community", it
                                        could be a cultural community, a hobby based community, or even a location based
                                        community. Communities can also create any kind of cooking events or maybe even
                                        just a simple community gatherings, such as "Traditional Cooking Class
                                        session", "Indonesian Cuisine Workshop", or "Chinese Food Lover Meetup".

                                        Above, we also mentioned "Community Representative". This role is made in this
                                        feature. When
                                        a community is created and verified, the creator of the community will be given
                                        the role of Community Representative. This role has the authority to talk on the
                                        FeedCrumbs
                                        representing the community.

                                                we can search by name, location, and type of community. This feature
                                                functions similiar to searchbar in FeedCrumbs, there will be forms and

                                                The list of communities available is the main content of this page.
                                                There will be like a grid like with the names and images of the

                                                This will be a bit similiar to how Facebook groups works, we can see the
                                                click on the communities, and we can see the contents, or even join as a

                                                Specifically for the community page, in order to mitigate the risk
                                                of the creation of innapropriate groups, users and community
                                                representatives can report if there is an innapropriate community that
                                                misrepresents a community or the community, and appropiate actions will
                                                be taken to remove the community if necessary.

                                                Because there will be a grid of colorful cards, WCAG 1.4.3 (contrast) is
                                                important to make sure
                                                the cards always have good contrast with the background and especially
                                                with the texts.

                                                by the community that the user opened. This feature allow users to

                                                ideas for a specific community. The example usecase for this function is
                                                when a user want to create a OZvents in a community, and they want to

                                                by creating cultural events. All OZvents created in this page will be

                                                Official Community OZvents, which means that the event will be

                                                instead of a small-scale personal event.

                                                In order to create the Communal OZvents, there will be a collaborative

                                                calendar, and also assign tasks to different members. All of this are
                                                created in mind so that the process of creating a community event can be

                                                identified. Also, as discussed above, knowing and learning about the
                                                community is the first step to connect and represent the community.
                                                Therefore
                                                this community wiki, called "Lores" is created to answer these needs.

                                                Lores will also function similiar to the notion-like collaborative page
                                                above. Community representatives can collaboratively with other

                                                can also suggest edits, but the final edit decision will be made by the
                                                community representatives. Because every community is unique, and may
                                                desribe themself uniquely, communities can create their Lores however
                                                they like, a markdown based rich text editor will be provided to make it
                                                easier to create and edit the structures and contents inside the lores.
