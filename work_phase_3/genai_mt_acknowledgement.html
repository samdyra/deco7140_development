                    <p>
                        Due to my limited design and CSS Skills, I mainly used Claude to help me design some code that I
                        already have built the structure. For example, the gallery, typograhy, and navbar components are
                        either built by myself or following the IA slides (some from WP2), and then I ask Claude to give
                        me suggestions on how to improve it. This way, I still have control over the final design, and I
                        can still learn from the suggestions given by Claude.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Furtheremore, contextually heavy like ethical response, site map annotation, and style guides
                        annotations, I use Quillbot and Claude to help me improve my grammar and overall english
                        sentences, and also give me feedbacks on accessibility considerations, ethics, and UX/UI
                        principles.

                    <p>
                        For design and code related sections like navbar, gallery, and typography, I make sure to try as
                        best as possible first to create my own version of the code first. After that, if I have
                        difficulties or feel like I want to improve some of the design, then I will ask Claude to give
                        me suggestions on how to improve my existing code. Even though some of the code given was very
                        good, most of them have advanced CSS and I could not understand the code. Therefore,
                        rather than copy paste the code, I mostly try to learn the code given by the AI and implement it
                        myself.

                        Furtheremore, I also make sure for contextually heavy sections like ethical response, site map
                        annotation, and style guides annotations, I only use it to either improve my grammar and overall
                        english sentences, and also give me feedbacks on accessibility considerations, ethics, and UX/UI
                        principles. I make sure all the suggestions given are accurate and relevant to my original work,
                        and therefore I still have control over the final work given.

                    <p>
                        I carefully reviewed all the genreated code by AI. Other than that, since my prompts are mostly
                        feedback related, and I also already have the original design, I did not copy pasted entire code
                        generated by AI, I only use several line of codes given whenever neccesesarry. I also make sure
                        all of the components still follows the color scheme and overall existing design layout that
                        were established before, and therefore the AI did not alter any ethical effect regarding the
                        designs.

                    <p>
                        Unlike work phase 2, in this work phase 3, I used Claude more often in learning the theories
                        like Gestalt Principles, Color Theory, Ethics, Accessibility, and UX/UI principles. I think this
                        is a good way to learn the theories, since I can ask Claude to explain more about the theories
                        in a more simpler way, and also give me examples that are relevant to my current work.

                        I used these AI/MT tools to support and supplement my learning and work in this work phase 3.
                        All generated code, suggestions, and feedbacks were critically reviewed and adapted based on
                        my own needs and also the ethical considerations. I ensure the final work given reflects my
                        understandings and capabilities.
