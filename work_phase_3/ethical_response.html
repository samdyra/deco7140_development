                    subscription plugin on the FeedCrumb Project. This response addresses the ethical considerations and

                    First off, I want to acknowledge that I feel honored and eager to work with Connected Communities
                    Initiative, especially considering the noble nature of the project's goal. The newsletter
                    subscription feature you have written in the client brief present a big oppportunity to get to know
                    the community members, and surely will be useful to engage with the actual communities later down
                    the road. However, In addition to support your goal and mission, as the design team we have a
                    responsibility to ensure that the features we will implement always aligns with care, to protect
                    the communities and the people that use it. In order to accomplish this, we have created some
                    analysis in order to answer your request, including considering the professional standards. Below,
                    I have structured 3 sections, including our ethical analysis, our reccommendation, and explanation
                    on how our reccommendation will benefits not only the users, but you as the client.

                            After some careful considerations of your newsletter plugin, we have point out several
                            significant ethical concerns that we have to pay attention to. These concerns rooted from
                            the principles in the ACS Code of Professional Ethics, especially regarding the Value of
                            Trustworthiness, Honesty, and Respect.

                                        From the client brief, the plugin includes several personal data that was not
                                        described how its going to be relevant with the goal of the project. Data such
                                        as annual income, credit cards, gender,spending habits, monthly dining
                                        expenditure
                                        will raise serious questions by the users regarding how the data will be used.
                                        According
                                        to the ACS principle of trustworthiness, professionals are ought to respect
                                        privacy and
                                        data confidentiality, especially personal data. The current data collected
                                        planned in the

                                    The client brief noted that the informations gathered from the form will help
                                    understand the users for future planning. After careful look, this argument has not
                                    been supported with some spesific explanation. This in turn will make it hard
                                    for us to justify to the users on why and how the data such as "spending habits"
                                    will be used, stored, or shared. The ACS Code mentioned that the importance of
                                    how we as a professional must maintain honesty in designing our products or
                                    services.
                                    Without clear disclosure on how we are going to use these personal data will raise
                                    high concerns to the users, and therefore might hinder user participation in the
                                    project.

                                    organization will serve multiple diverse communities, and some of them which may
                                    have a systemic disadvantage, collecting this kind of data might pose a big threat
                                    for them if those data somehow leaked inside or outside of the website that we want
                                    to create. As the ACS principle of respect mentioned, respect for others is an
                                    essential principle and we have to minimize any harm to stakeholders, including the
                                    personal data of the users.
