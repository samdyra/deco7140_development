                            <td>The website shows people and community pridefully showing their true self.
                                Annotation: Representation of both individualy and community is first step to
                                build connections. Showing example contents that show people and communities proudly
                                expressing themself, such as images of people showing their culture, tradition,
                                and activities, will encourage users to also express themself and their authentic
                                culture. By pridefully representing themself to others, the users basically open up
                                themself to the communities, and naturally interactions, engagements, and connections
                                will be built. But to accomplish this, people will have to feel safe and respected,
                                therefore the second value below.

                            </td>
                            <td>Images of people who expressively shows their culture in the home page especially in
                                the highlight section. Showcase of activities in the Highlight section, showing
                                expressive activities from different events by the people/community. Also, in the
                                communities page, similiar with the homepage, a call to actions for users to create/join
                                communities and share their stories, ideas, experiences, like "Share your story together
                                with us", "Establish connection through your voice", "Express yourself freely".
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Cultural Inclusivity</td>
                            <td>Culturally different people and communities interact with each other,
                                showing genuine compassion and tolerance.
                                Annotation: In order to allow people freely express themself, and thereby build
                                meaningful connections, people should first feel safe and respected, no matter their
                                background, culture, origin, age etc. By maintaining a culturally inclusive design
                                decisions in contents such as images, languages, tones, colours etc, people will feel
                                more comfortable to express themself and build meaningful connections.
                            </td>
                            <td>In addition to people and communities who express themself, some images will also shows
                                people from different culture, origin, ages etc, interacting with each other. There will
                                be no stereotypical or "dominant" culture shown in the images, but rather a mix of
                                different cultures interacting with each other. This will also be made in the
                                Highlight section and "About Us" section, where there will be images of the team members
                                and also community representatives from different background, culture, age etc.

                            <td>Meaningful Connections</td>
                            <td>Add a feeling that the website "invite" users to connect with the diverse community
                                within the website. Annotation: One of the main purpose of this website is to build
                                connections, therefore the design should also feel like "inviting" users to connect with
                                the community. This can be done by using inviting words, and images in home page and
                                communities page.
                            </td>
                            <td>Welcome Message and buttons in the home page, especially in the header section to have
                                an "inviting" message like "Join Us", "Share your story", "Connect with others from
                                around the world" etc. In order to add a more personal touch, the welcome message
                                language will change periodically (in several seconds) to reflect different
                                cultures/languages around the world, such as "Join Us" - "√önete a nosotros" -
                                "Rejoignez-nous" - "Âä†ÂÖ•Êàë‰ª¨" - "–ü—Ä–∏—Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω—è–π—Ç–µ—Å—å –∫–Ω–∞–º", but appropriate translation will be
                                provided in english below the text, like "Translate to: Join us üá™üá∏".
