                                Annotation: Representation of both individualy and community is first step to
                                build connections. Showing example contents that show people and communities proudly
                                expressing themself, such as images of people showing their culture, tradition,
                                and activities, will encourage users to also express themself and their authentic
                                culture. By pridefully representing themself to others, the users basically open up
                                themself to the communities, and naturally interactions, engagements, and connections
                                will be built. But to accomplish this, people will have to feel safe and respected,
                                therefore the second value below.

                                Annotation: In order to allow people freely express themself, and thereby build
                                meaningful connections, people should first feel safe and respected, no matter their
                                background, culture, origin, age etc. By maintaining a culturally inclusive design
                                decisions in contents such as images, languages, tones, colours etc, people will feel
                                more comfortable to express themself and build meaningful connections.

                                be no stereotypical or "dominant" culture shown in the images, but rather a mix of
                                different cultures interacting with each other. This will also be made in the
                                Highlight section and "About Us" section, where there will be images of the team members
                                and also community representatives from different background, culture, age etc.

                                within the website. Annotation: One of the main purpose of this website is to build
                                connections, therefore the design should also feel like "inviting" users to connect with
                                the community. This can be done by using inviting words, and images in home page and
                                communities page.

                                around the world" etc. In order to add a more personal touch, the welcome message
                                language will change periodically (in several seconds) to reflect different
                                cultures/languages around the world, such as "Join Us" - "√önete a nosotros" -
                                "Rejoignez-nous" - "Âä†ÂÖ•Êàë‰ª¨" - "–ü—Ä–∏—Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω—è–π—Ç–µ—Å—å –∫–Ω–∞–º", but appropriate translation will be

                                    background, will feel safe and respected in order to do the second keyword,
                                    "Self

                                    express their true self, Welcoming, is to invite people to join communities and
                                    connect with people, and Compassionate, is to show genuine care and tolerance to
                                    people from different background.

                                    Here are some examples of imagery that can be used to reflect these emotional
                                    tones:

                                    As shown in the images above, the imagery aligned with the intended emotional
                                    tone
                                    and identity we want to create. Several important aspects of the images is
                                    first,
                                    there are diversity among the people shown in the images, in terms of culture,
                                    age,
                                    and the cuisines variety. Also, warm colors in the image create a welcoming
                                    atmosphere while also supported the proud face expression of the people
                                    in the images, which is joyful and proud of their culture. Their eyes and body
                                    language is also either directed to the camera, showing "inviting" vibes, or
                                    directed to each other, showing genuine interactions and connections.
                                    Personally, my
                                    favorite is the first image as it checklist all my intended emotional tone and
                                    identity.

                                    to

                                Impact to Users: As mentioeed by Lily in the user needs analysis, users with visual
                                impairment may have difficulty reading text with low contrast, which can make it
                                difficult for them to navigate and use the website.

                                How I Plan to Fix It: I will increase the contrast ratio by darkening the text color and
                                lightening the background color used in the color scheme. I also provide an alternative
                                text color for dark background, which is white (#FFFFFF), to be used in navbar. Due to
                                the high number of violations related to contrast, I already done fix this issue, and
                                the result is also have been implemented in this website, more details about the color
                                scheme is provided in the visceral page.

                                How I Plan to Fix It: I will ensure that all form inputs have a single label that
                                is associated with the input. I will also remove any invalid ARIA attributes from
                                non-interactive elements.

                                and purpose of the image used.

                                How I Plan to Fix It: I will ensure that all non-text content to have appropriate alt
                                text that
                                accurately describes the content and the purpose. Special case for this "Text
                                alternative is more than 150 characters", in this case, it is actually intentional
                                because we use the alt text as annotation. As for the lack of alt issue, I already fixed
                                this issue by adding alt text to all images that previously do not have alt text.
