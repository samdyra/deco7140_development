                                Annotation: Representation of both individualy and community is first step to
                                build connections. Showing example contents that show people and communities proudly
                                expressing themself, such as images of people showing their culture, tradition,
                                and activities, will encourage users to also express themself and their authentic
                                culture. By pridefully representing themself to others, the users basically open up
                                themself to the communities, and naturally interactions, engagements, and connections
                                will be built. But to accomplish this, people will have to feel safe and respected,
                                therefore the second value below.

                                Annotation: In order to allow people freely express themself, and thereby build
                                meaningful connections, people should first feel safe and respected, no matter their
                                background, culture, origin, age etc. By maintaining a culturally inclusive design
                                decisions in contents such as images, languages, tones, colours etc, people will feel
                                more comfortable to express themself and build meaningful connections.

                                be no stereotypical or "dominant" culture shown in the images, but rather a mix of
                                different cultures interacting with each other. This will also be made in the
                                Highlight section and "About Us" section, where there will be images of the team members
                                and also community representatives from different background, culture, age etc.

                                within the website. Annotation: One of the main purpose of this website is to build
                                connections, therefore the design should also feel like "inviting" users to connect with
                                the community. This can be done by using inviting words, and images in home page and
                                communities page.

                                around the world" etc. In order to add a more personal touch, the welcome message
                                language will change periodically (in several seconds) to reflect different
                                cultures/languages around the world, such as "Join Us" - "√önete a nosotros" -
                                "Rejoignez-nous" - "Âä†ÂÖ•Êàë‰ª¨" - "–ü—Ä–∏—Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω—è–π—Ç–µ—Å—å –∫–Ω–∞–º", but appropriate translation will be

                                    I want to revolve the website identity around "An inclusive platform that foster
                                    meaningful connections through self expression". There are three keywords, the first
                                    is "Inclusive", which means the
                                    website should be designed to be inclusive, so that people from different
                                    background, will feel safe and respected in order to do the second keyword, "Self
                                    Expression", which is the way for people to show their true self, and in this case,
                                    expresing themself through their cultural cuisine, and by doing so, they can do the
                                    third keyword, which is to create "meaningful connections" with other
                                    people/community in the platform.

                                    In order to show the identity of the website, we will create emotial tone of
                                    Proud, Welcoming, and Compassionate. Proud, is to encourage people to proudly
                                    express their true self, Welcoming, is to invite people to join communities and
                                    connect with people, and Compassionate, is to show genuine care and tolerance to
                                    people from different background.

                                    Here are some examples of imagery that can be used to reflect these emotional tones:

                                    <br>
                                    <br>

                                        alt="Second example of an image of a group of diverse people happily sharing food and drinks at a table">

                                    >
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="../work_phase_3/assets/imagery-3.png" class="small-responsive-img"
                                        alt="Third example of an image of a group of diverse people happily sharing food and drinks at a table">
                                    >
                                    <br>

                                    As shown in the images above, the imagery aligned with the intended emotional tone
                                    and identity we want to create. Several important aspects of the images is first,
                                    there are diversity among the people shown in the images, in terms of culture, age,
                                    and the cuisines variety. Also, warm colors in the image create a welcoming
                                    atmosphere while also supported the proud face expression of the people
                                    in the images, which is joyful and proud of their culture. Their eyes and body
                                    language is also either directed to the camera, showing "inviting" vibes, or
                                    directed to each other, showing genuine interactions and connections. Personally, my
                                    favorite is the first image as it checklist all my intended emotional tone and
                                    identity.

                                    In addition, to add a more "welcoming" vibe, I will add a short message of something

                                    values and user needs. Here is the checklist:
                                </p>

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Use specific nation/community names when possible (for example "Yawuru
                                        people" not just "Aboriginal people")

                                        This also reflect on User Need 1 and 2 in Value 1, Identity Representation,
                                        where users want to see autenthic representation of their own culture and
                                        community.
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        In Lores (Wiki) content, consult with community representatives before
                                        publishing
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        For CrumbsMap overlay layers, work with community representatives to ensure
                                        accurate representation of Indigenous lands and other historical sites.
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        Refer to Australian as "Australians", not "migrants" or "foreigners"
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        Use "they/them" as default gender neutral pronouns
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        In Event descriptions (OZvents), use "Participants" or "attendees" not gendered
                                        terms
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        Only mention age when relevant
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Avoid terms like "myth," "legend," "folklore" when referring to spiritual
                                        beliefs especially I wil have Lores (Wiki) content.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                Original Example Text:
                                <br>

                                "Express Yourself, and Connect With the World"
                                "Join a community that celebrates culture and connection"
                                <br>

                                Revised Example Text:
                                <br>

                                "Express Yourself, and Connect With the World"
                                "Join communities that celebrate culture and connection"

                                <br>
                                Annotation: In the revised text, I changed "a community" to "communities" to
                                reflect the inclusivity of different cultures and communities, and also to avoid
                                the implication that there is only one community that users can join.
