                        As planned on the sitemap, this part of screen is consisting of 3 main features, landing page, highlights, and about. Firstly, in the landing page, I used the Gestalt Principles, Law of Pr√§gnanz. I use simple texts with buttons, basic shapes, and a simple background. To make sure I adhere to contrast minimum (WCAG 1.4.3), I do not plan on using an image for the background. I intend to use a minimum decorations to fill the white space in the landing page. This too also following the Gestalt principle of Figure and Ground, which is to make sure the main contents stand out to the background. Moving on to next section which is the highlight, I actually put it very near to to the landing page, so that the user can see the highlight from the first time when opening the page, making it easier and hopefully acts as a hook for the user. In order to make sure its not cluttered, i apply the Gestalt Principles of Common Regions. I boxed in the highlight section using border so that the separation of the contents clearer. Lastly, the about page is provided near the bottom of the page. Identical to the other sections, because there is images in this part, I will make sure to apply alt text in order to adhere WCAG 1.1.1 (alt text for non-text content). Overall, I also apply Gestalt Principles of Proximity, and Gestalt Principles of Similarity by using consistent spacing between things that are connected and non-connected, and consistent designs such for buttons, text, and colors (later on design implementation). Mobile specific: Some of the components layouts are changed (for example row become columns), in order to maintain consistent spacings and prevent cluttering.

The most obvious one is Contrast Minimum and Resize text, this accessibility considerations is very important because the page is very wordy, therefore we have to make the user can easily read the texts, and also the page is not cluttered in case a bigger texts is needed for visually impaired users. Form and input related accessibility considerations such as Error Identification, Focus Visible, and Label & Instructions is also needed in this page, since there are several textbox and inputs in this page. This accessibility consideration is important to make sure user can easily interact with the forms and input, such as adding labels in the forms, and also error message if theres a misuse in the text box (such as message too long)."

The contrast minimum consideration is even more important in this page since the the main background of this page is basically a map, which may consist colorful contents (depending on the basemap and layers used by the users). To make an emphasis on this matter, texts inside the map will not only be using a contrast background, but the background will also have strong border, so users can easily identify the texts and boxes inside the map. Mobile specific: in order to not make the visuals is not cluttered, the side bar is hidden by default, and can be opened by clicking the button on the top right of the map. "
